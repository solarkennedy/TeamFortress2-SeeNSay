About
====

This is for sound extraction.

Dependencies
====

I don't remember everything. 
* Linux?
* sox
* An sdcard
* TF2/Steam on linux 

Theory
====

1. The makefile uses hlextract takes a tf2 package and extracts all the sounds
2. pick-sounds.sh grabs only the sounds that make sense to use in this application
3. copy the contents of the sdcard folder to your sdcard
