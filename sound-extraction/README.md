About

This is for sound extraction.

Dependencies
====

I don't remember everything.

* An sdcard
* TF2/Steam on linux 

Theory
====

# hlextract takes a tf2 package and extracts all the sounds
# pick-sounds.sh grabs only the sounds that make sense to use in this application
# convert-sounds.sh makes a folder "sdcard" and preps it with compatible waves
# copy the contents of the sdcard folder to your sdcard
